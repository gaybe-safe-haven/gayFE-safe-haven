      <p>In the face of an increasingly hostile political climate towards LGBTQ+ individuals, it`&apos;`s more important than ever to provide safe spaces for homeless LGBTQ+ youth</p>
      {/* <img></img> */}
      <p>We wanted to make an app that would let vulnerable youth search for LGBTQ+-friendly shelters across the United States</p>
      <p>but  a national database of LGBTQ+-friendly shelters didn`&apos;`t exist!</p>
      <p>So, we`&apos;`re building a comprehensive list of LGBTQ+-friendly youth shelters across the United States</p>
      <p>and we need YOUR HELP!</p>
      {/* <img></img> */}
      <p>If you know of a shelter that should be on our list, please add it. And if you`&apos;`ve had an experience with a shelter that`&apos;`s already on our list, please rate it to help others make informed decisions. Together, we can create a network of support and protection for queer and trans youth who need it the most.</p>
